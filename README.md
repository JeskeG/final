## Functionality and Explanation:
A web app to allow a user to schedule a meeting with others. Enter desired
meeting date and time range and others' emails. Scheduler will receive unique
URLs for each person they added which they must email to the user. When that URL is
accessed, users will be asked to log in to their google account and then
select their calendars to update their availability. Final page will show common
free times among users who have responded by updating their availability.

I chose to allow any user update their availability and and re-enter as many
times as they wish to give flexibility. I also let every user see the common open
times so they may know when a meeting may potentially get scheduled. Given more time
I would have liked to add email features instead of simply giving the requester
links to send to others and a final email feature in which the scheduler can notify
others when the meeting gets set. It would add one additional feature of an
admin password key so that only the scheduler could select the meeting, but
it wouldn't be too difficult. Alas, its a version 2 idea.
